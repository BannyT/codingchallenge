Project: Front End – Interview Task
 Overview
This is a front-end project built as part of an interview assignment, showcasing a clean and modern pricing section using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates my ability to structure UI components, apply visual design principles, and write maintainable code using modern web development practices.

Approach
Separation of Concerns

I separated the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into individual files (App.js, App.css) to improve clarity, modularity, and scalability.

Responsive Layout

Used Flexbox to create a responsive grid that adapts across screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Ensured accessibility and readability by using semantic HTML and relative units for layout.

Modern Design

Implemented glassmorphism and soft UI effects to give the  cards a modern and appealing look.

Incorporated smooth transitions and hover effects to enhance interactivity and user engagement.



Modal popups

Plan selection logic

API integrations (e.g., fetching real-time Data)

MY Final Thoughts
This project reflects my design philosophy:

Keep things simple, clean, and scalable

Use modern tools and best practices

Write readable and maintainable code

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skills.
