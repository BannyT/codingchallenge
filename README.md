# Front-End Interview Task – Skip Size Selector Redesign

## Overview

This project is a front-end redesign assignment for the “Choose Your Skip Size” page from [WeWantWaste](https://wewantwaste.co.uk/). It demonstrates my ability to build clean, responsive UI components with React, maintainable code structure, and modern design aesthetics.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **CSS** (with Flexbox for layout)
- **JavaScript **

## Objectives

- Redesign the page to look **completely different** while retaining original functionality.
- Make it **responsive** on both desktop and mobile.
- Populate skip data dynamically via **API integration**.
- Apply **modern design principles** (glassmorphism, soft UI, clean typography).

## Approach

###  Planning
- Sketched the layout on paper to visualize user flow and information hierarchy.
- Defined component structure and planned responsive breakpoints.

### Modularity
- Separated logic (`App.js`) and styles (`App.css`) for better scalability.
- Reusable component structure to allow future extension.

### UI/UX Design
- Implemented **glassmorphism** and **soft UI** for modern appeal.
- Used **hover states**, **transitions**, and **shadows** for interactivity.
- Ensured good **contrast, spacing**, and **font readability**.

### Responsive Layout
- Used **Flexbox and media queries** for mobile-first responsiveness.
- Optimized layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

### API Integration
- I Consumed live skip data via:
  `https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft`

### Features
- Responsive grid layout for skip options
- Selection logic with visual feedback
- Modal handling (if applicable)
- Loading/error states

 Final Thoughts
    This project reflects my front-end development approach:

    Keep it simple, elegant, and scalable

    Prioritize clean UI and strong UX

    Use modern tools and write maintainable code

    Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skills.
